## 🛞 Part Identification
- **Precise Part Name:** Crankshaft with Pistons Assembly
- **Confidence Level:** 95%
- **Alternate / Synonym Names:** Engine Crankshaft, Crankshaft Assembly
- **Short Reasoning:** The image shows a crankshaft connected to pistons, which are typical components of an internal combustion engine.

## 📘 Technical Description
- **Function:** Converts the linear motion of pistons into rotational motion to drive the vehicle''s drivetrain.
- **Typical Applications & Use-Cases:** Found in internal combustion engines of cars, trucks, and other vehicles.
- **Key Differences vs. Visually-Similar Components:** Unlike camshafts, crankshafts are connected to pistons and feature a series of offset throws.
