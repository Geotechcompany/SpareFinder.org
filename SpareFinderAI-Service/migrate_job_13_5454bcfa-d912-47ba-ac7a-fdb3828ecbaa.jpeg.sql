### 🛞 Part Identification
- **Precise Part Name:** Crankshaft Assembly with Pistons
- **Confidence Level:** 95%
- **Alternate / Synonym Names:** Engine Crankshaft, Crankshaft and Piston Assembly
- **Short Reasoning:** The visible configuration of pistons connected to a crankshaft is characteristic of an internal combustion engine component, typically seen in automotive applications.

### 📘 Technical Description
- **Function:** Converts linear motion of pistons into rotational motion to drive the vehicle''s wheels.
- **Typical Applications & Use-Cases:** Commonly used in internal combustion engines for cars, trucks, and other vehicles.
- **Key Differences vs. Visually-Similar Components:** Unlike camshafts or other rotating shafts, crankshafts are directly connected to pistons and feature counterweights.
