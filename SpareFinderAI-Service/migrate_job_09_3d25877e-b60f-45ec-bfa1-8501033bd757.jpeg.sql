- **Precise Part Name:** Crankshaft with Pistons
- **Confidence Level:** 95%
- **Alternate / Synonym Names:** Engine Crankshaft Assembly, Crank and Piston Assembly
- **Short Reasoning:** The image shows a series of pistons connected to a crankshaft, a key component in internal combustion engines, characterized by the distinctive rotary motion of the crankshaft and the vertical movement of the pistons.

## 📘 Technical Description

- **Function:** Converts the linear motion of pistons into rotational motion to drive the vehicle''s drivetrain.
- **Typical Applications & Use-Cases:** Commonly used in internal combustion engines for cars, trucks, and motorcycles.
- **Key Differences vs. Visually-Similar Components:** Unlike camshafts, crankshafts are designed to convert piston motion into rotary motion rather than control valve timing.
