### 🛞 Part Identification
- **Precise Part Name**: 
  - Top Left: Valve Spring
  - Top Right: Crankshaft
  - Bottom Left: Bearing
  - Bottom Right: Engine Block or Cylinder Head Gasket
- **Confidence Level**: 95%
- **Alternate / Synonym Names**: 
  - Valve Spring: Coil Spring
  - Crankshaft: Engine Shaft
  - Bearing: Roller Bearing
  - Engine Block/Cylinder Head Gasket: Engine Gasket
- **Short Reasoning**: The parts are identified based on their distinct shapes and typical features. Valve springs are helical and metallic. Crankshafts have distinct lobes and journals. Bearings have an inner and outer race with rolling elements. The gasket has multiple holes for cylinder alignment and sealing.

### 📘 Technical Description
- **Function**:
  - Valve Spring: Maintains tension on engine valves.
  - Crankshaft: Converts linear piston motion to rotational motion.
  - Bearing: Reduces friction between moving parts.
  - Engine Block/Cylinder Head Gasket: Seals engine components to prevent leaks.
- **Typical Applications & Use-Cases**:
  - Used in internal combustion engines for daily driving, performance vehicles, and commercial applications.
- **Key Differences**:
  - Valve springs differ from suspension springs by their size and application.
  - Crankshafts are distinct from camshafts by their larger size and function.
  - Bearings vary by type (ball, roller) and application.
  - Gaskets differ in material and design based on engine type.
