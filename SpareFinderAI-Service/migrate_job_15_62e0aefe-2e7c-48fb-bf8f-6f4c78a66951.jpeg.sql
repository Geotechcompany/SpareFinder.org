### 🛞 Part Identification
- **Precise Part Name:** Crankshaft with Pistons
- **Confidence Level:** 95%
- **Alternate / Synonym Names:** Crank assembly, Engine crankshaft
- **Short Reasoning:** The image shows a crankshaft assembly with pistons attached, identifiable by the connecting rods and crank pins typical of internal combustion engines.

### 📘 Technical Description
- **Function:** Converts the linear motion of pistons into rotational motion to power a vehicle.
- **Typical Applications & Use-Cases:** Used in internal combustion engines across various vehicle types, including cars, trucks, and motorcycles.
- **Key Differences vs. Visually-Similar Components:** Unlike camshafts, crankshafts have offset crankpins for piston connection, and the assembly includes pistons.
